#### Project Management

Our project management strategy is centered around effective stakeholder engagement, risk management, and timeline adherence. We will employ a phased approach to project delivery, ensuring each phase is completed to the satisfaction of GRIDCo before proceeding to the next.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Establish clear communication channels with GRIDCo and relevant stakeholders to ensure timely decision-making and issue resolution.
- **Risk Management:** Implement a proactive risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Timeline Adherence:** Utilize advanced project management tools to monitor progress and ensure adherence to project timelines and milestones.
