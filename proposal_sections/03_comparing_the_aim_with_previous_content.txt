### Comparing the Aim with Previous Content

Once the aim is clear, the next step is to scrutinize the original content provided for the section. Was the methodology section in the original proposal clearly articulated? Did it adequately describe the processes and techniques used? Was there enough detail to allow another researcher to replicate the study? Was the language professional and technical, reflecting the complexity and depth of the research? Any gaps or areas lacking clarity in the original text should be identified, as these are the points that require more attention in the expansion.
